# Daily UX Challenge

In this challenge, you will customize a Bootstrap Alert.

## Instructions

- Link `style.css` to `alert.html`.

- The Bootstrap CDN has already been linked in your HTML.  Visit [Bootstrap - Alerts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/), copy the source code for an alert, and paste it into the body of your HTML.

- Re-design the alert component.  Consider changing font, background color, margins, paddings, and border, etc.  You might consider adding a shadow.  Try to use at least one pseudo class.

- Share your design on slack and with others around you.

## Hints

- Read more about using the box-shadow property at [W3 Schools - Box Shadow](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.asp).
